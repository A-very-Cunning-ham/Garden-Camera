The Garden Camera project is deisnged to use a Raspberry Pi and an Amazon Alexa device to monitor and control a home garden. This is acheived by using the AWS Alexa developer console linked to the Raspberry Pi with a HTTPS endpoint. All Alexa code is run locally on the RPi by using Python and the Flask-Ask module. To connect Alexa to the Python a flask server was used with ngrok HTTPS 5000 tunneling. 
When Alexa receives a invocation it sends a JSON file to the RPi server where flask determines the proper function to run based on the intent name. Two main intnets are available to run. These intents are described below:
GPIOControlIntent: This intent accepts two slots, one number slot and one literal slot. These slots allow the user to define a GPIO pin and a requested state. Once invoked this function modifies the GPIO output on the RPi to the user's request. This allows for the control of numerous electrical devices that may be connected to the RPi.
